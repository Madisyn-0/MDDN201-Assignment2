            <p class="info-text">
                Markup languages encode documents with a set of rules and tags that format the overall presentation of a web page and its contents. They are formatted in a human-readable and machine readable way with keywords and names that define elements. The browser interprets the Markup language and structures it according to the text defined in tags.

            <p class="info-text">
                Programming languages hold the commands and syntax that are compiled to instruct a computer to produce outputs and perform tasks. They can be used to develop software programs, operating systems, scripts, and  web, desktop and mobile applications. Java, Python and C++ are examples of programming languages.

            <p class="info-text">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) are the foundations of all web pages.

            <p class="info-text">JavaScript is a high level programming language that can be used to develop features for the internet. Working alongside HTML, it can perform more advanced web design tasks and make a site interactive. Unlike Java, it does not need to be compiled in order to run it. JavaScript's good front and back end design makes it an easy language to use.</p>
